This means you have to wait until the previous entry has been fully consumed to add another. Nested callbacks should be used to add multiple entries. There are modules like [async](https://npmjs.org/package/async) that ease the so called \"callback hell\".\n\nIf you want a module that handles entry queueing and much more, you should check out [archiver](https://npmjs.org/package/archiver) which uses this module internally.\n\n```js\nvar packer = require('zip-stream');\nvar archive = new packer(); // OR new packer(options)\n\narchive.on('error', function(err) {\n  throw err;\n});\n\n// pipe archive where you want it (ie fs, http, etc)\n// listen to the destination's end, close, or finish event\n\narchive.entry('string contents', { name: 'string.txt' }, function(err, entry) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  archive.entry(null, { name: 'directory/' }, function(err, entry) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    archive.finish();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nConcept inspired by Antoine van Wel's [zipstream](https://npmjs.org/package/zipstream) module, which is no longer being updated.",
